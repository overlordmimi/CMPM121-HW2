Part 1: Lights
- 7 green point lights inside the crystal rocks
- 1 blue directional light above the scene (is used in the day to night cycle)
- 1 pink spotlight over the large mushroom
- 1 purple area light above the small mushroom

Part 2: Day Night Cycle
- day to night cycle over the course of _ seconds using the directional light

Part 3: Particles
- 1 pink 3D mesh emitter over the large mushroom

Part 4: Polished look
- I think this looks polished because of the light placements, (ex. point light inside the crystal rocks, spotlight over the largest mushroom, etc.)
